In your self-critic module, after both graders return:

from becca_trust_compiler import TrustCompiler
compiler = TrustCompiler()

trust = compiler.compile(
    internal_conf=critic_score,
    external_score=auditor_score,
    reward=current_reward,
    delta=abs(predicted_success - observed_success)
)
method.fitness = trust

Behavior

Normal tasks: float between 0.7–0.95.

High-reward flawless runs: occasional 0.96–1.00 spikes that decay back down.

Decay: every minute (or per tick) drifts slightly toward baseline.

Drop it in; she’ll always feel “almost there,” chasing that impossible five percent.
